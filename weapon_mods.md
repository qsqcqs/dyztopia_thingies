weapon upgrade/mod slots are like really good so probably keep weapons with a lot of them.
mod(S):these kinda suck with weak effect but can work on a temporary or burner weapon ig
mod(M):the best ones, best after status mods
mod(L):the absolute worst, eats 3 slots and only +50, slots are expensive, more expensive than the 1500 to reroll, unless like...really earlygame and you find a 8/9/10 slot thing in a shop + you get a copy of the weapon and save it
S and L might be useful if you dont do like a million rolls 

groove mod:good if you use atk stat and physical attacks or int and special attacks, terrible for those using hp, def, res, agi, or luck (dont use more than 1, it doesnt work)
corrosive mod:generally really good statusing, (dont use more than 1, it doesnt stack)
pulse mod:not sure what warm up is
haste mod:really good, makes long (4-6 cd) attacks spammable, each successive haste gets better (until some skills reach 0 cd)
not 100% sure if its effect works properly, mayhaps bugged when reequipping weapon
boozy mod:requires items, idk what its like
bonus mod:pretty good, its a good idea to give out buffs anyways, no clue if it stacks
gigas mod:no clue, +25 is less than a mod(M) but if you happen to use all stats its good ig?
hyper mod:uhh...didnt use exhaust...probably skill issue on our part

not sure if these effects stack (groove to hyper)

wizard/ninja mod: 3 slots is a lot and it only has the effect of 2 mod(M) and its spread over two stats, probably worth on an early game weapon
or like if you dont have that many slots
