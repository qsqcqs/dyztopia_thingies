atk and def are really good
dont use int as main stat, it is so bad ong

needs like 4-6 haste for insane spam if it stacks like I think it does

big atk build{
	keep starting weapon (baby shuriken) and give it like:
	bonus:always should buff chars
	corrosive:just good debuff
	groove mod:buffs are always nice, helps that kunai strike is 
	phys and a decent chunk of other atks also are
	mayhaps 1 haste? : no clue if it works
	arcane force: really good if you can find it
	fill the rest with atk(M)
}


could work as a res tank and like heal and stuff
getting res to lv 30 is a lot but its probably worth
if your maining it
{
	diamond is a really good shard
	and ultra heal, works really well with detritus ruin
	not too much good res dmg ngl
	
	spider guy???
}
