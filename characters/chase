agi{
	max multi kicker is nice, get to low hp quickly without dying + big dmg
	bonfire:not sure what restoring O CD on defeat means
	going up to x5 at lv 3 probably means lv 1 and 2 arent too big dmg?
	flash jab cd and other upgrades nice ig, mainly cd ig?
	bolt punch is uncommon-ish thunder dmg
	costume is nice for atk

	deadly dervish is probably good for agi based stuff
	death fist does either 2x or 5x atk, not sure which but guessing x2 off feel so its bad
	volcano volley seems nice but needs hype
	octobolt is nice
	phyr...is agi based

	agi really is harder to get and has fewer uses...
