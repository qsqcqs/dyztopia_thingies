if haste works like I think
{
	candy slinger
	seasonal mod obviously (unless its actually sept/oct)
	3 haste would be nice (if it stacks)
	groove and corrosive are good as always
	arcane force?
	fill rest with fortune or
	maybe atk? not sure
	if 2 or 3 haste works, envenom would be spammable which would be op
	costume luck on its own is good and toxice is really good cc

	asterisks other charm + music box is big luck
	works well with taurus, coffee break heal is questionable, its
	mainly the other effects imo so the 60% res doesnt matter
	dire mire is good for just getting poison on
	null number is good always

	honestly no sure how to turn luck into damage
}
